					<h2>My Story</h2>
					
					<p>I was thrilled to be accepted into the University of California, Riverside as a Theatre, Film, and Digital Productions major with a concentration in film. However, I soon learned that I wanted to pursue computer science and the gaming industry. I shifted my focus towards computer science and taught myself Python in my dormroom and took a C++ course the following Sophomore year. Though I would most likely be unable to switch majors to computer science because it is a different college at my university. Disappointed, I decided that I should pursue a minor in marketing so that I can graduate on time, and focus my studies on business and computer science while taking classes for my digital productions major. I have since taken a liking to streaming and managed to build a dual PC streaming set up and had the fortune to struggle with the audio portion of the set up for what seemed like one hundred hours.   </p>
